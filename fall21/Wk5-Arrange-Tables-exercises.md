# Arrange Tables In-Class Exercises

The goal of this exercise is to gain experience thinking about data types and proposing chart idioms appropriate for that data.
 
## Preparation 

Familiarize yourself with the following datasets *before* class begins.
* Women in STEM majors, https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors, https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/college-majors/women-stem.csv
* Wildfires in the US during August (2000-2021), https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/societal-impacts/wildfires/month/8/data.csv

These datasets come from the collection at https://observablehq.com/@mkfreeman/teaching-datasets

## Exercises

We'll gather in to groups of 3-4 students per Zoom breakout room. I'll give you 10-15 minutes for each question/task and then we'll gather back to discuss the question. 

For each question/task:
* Propose idioms that could be used.  Justify your choices by listing
  * data items and marks used to encode those data items
  * data attributes, their data types, and the channels used to encode those attributes
* Note any data manipulation you might need to do on the data to answer the question.  For instance, you may need to aggregate data or create new attributes containing derived data.
* *Sketch* (no programming needs to be involved) what the chart might look like (you don't have to include exact data points)
* What further questions does your charts prompt you to ask?  What other data might you need to answer your questions?

When we gather back together in the main Zoom room, I'll ask a couple groups to share your sketch (either by camera or screen sharing)

**Q1.**

Compare the share of women in the STEM major categories (Biology & Life Science, Computing & Mathematics, Engineering, Health, Physical Sciences).

**Q2.**

Is there a correlation between the share of women in a STEM major and that major's median earnings?  Are there outliers from the norm? 

Related: How does the major category play into this relationship?  What about the total number of students in that major?

**Q3.**

What is the trend in the number of acres burned per fire during the month of August in the US between 2000-2021?
